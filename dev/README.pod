Handling delimited pod blocks:
=============================

Maintain a stack of open pod blocks. The head 
block, if any, is a "parent" block and may have
child blocks.

Dealing with line types:

  if a line is a begin line
      push this to the open block stack

  elsif a line is an end line
      if there is a parent block
         check that the tail label matches, else an error
         if the head matches the tail
             we are out of pod, append the parent to
                the parent stack and empty the open block stack

  elsif there is an open block element 
      next line

Note it is an error to have both an open pod block
and be in a heredoc.
